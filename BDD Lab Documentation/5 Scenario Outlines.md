# Scenario Outlines
Scenario Outlines in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) allow you to create more flexible and data-driven tests. 
They're particularly useful when you need to test the same scenario with multiple sets of input data. 
This tutorial segment will explain how to use Scenario Outlines effectively.

## Segment: Working with Scenario Outlines
Scenario Outlines are a powerful feature in BDD that enables you to run the same scenario with different sets of data. 
They help you avoid duplicating code and make your tests more maintainable and expressive. 
Let's dive into how to work with Scenario Outlines:

#### 1. Basic Syntax
A Scenario Outline starts with the Scenario Outline keyword, similar to a regular Scenario. 
However, it includes placeholders (typically enclosed in < >) to represent the dynamic data you want to use in your scenario.
```
Feature: Search input
    Scenario: Valid search option
        Given a user navigates to the search page
        When they enter valid search input
        Then they should receive correct search suggestion

 Examples:
| Input |   Movie Title   | 
| 'A'   | 'Alien vs Ogre' | 
| 'I'   |   'Iron Boy'    |
| 'O'   |   'Owltopia'    |
```

#### 2. The Examples Table

The Examples table is where you provide the actual data that will be substituted into the placeholders in the Scenario Outline. 
Each row in the table represents a separate test scenario. 
In the above example, there are 2 sets of data, each with input and movie title.

#### 3. Running Scenario Outlines

To run Scenario Outlines, execute Behave as you would for regular feature files. 
Behave will iterate through the Examples and run the Scenario Outline once for each set of data, creating separate test scenarios for each.

`behave features/search.feature`

## Benefits of Scenario Outlines
Data-Driven Testing: Scenario Outlines allow you to test multiple data combinations without duplicating scenarios.

Clarity: They make your feature files more readable and concise, as you avoid redundant scenarios.

Maintainability: Changes in the scenario logic require updates in one place rather than multiple duplicated scenarios.

## Best Practices
Keep the Examples table clean and organized for readability.

Use type hints in step definitions to ensure proper data types.

Ensure your Scenario Outline provides a clear structure and doesn't mix too many concepts within a single outline.

Use descriptive placeholders to improve readability, like `<username>` and `<password>` instead of `<field_1>` and `<field_2>`.

Scenario Outlines are a valuable tool in BDD, especially when dealing with repetitive tests and various data inputs. 
By following these practices, you can make your BDD tests more efficient, maintainable, and expressive.
