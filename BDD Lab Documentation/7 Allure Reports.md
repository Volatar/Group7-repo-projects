# Allure Reports
Creating Allure reports for your Selenium BDD tests in PyCharm is an excellent way to visualize and share test results with your team or stakeholders. 
Allure is a powerful reporting framework that provides detailed and interactive reports. 
In this tutorial segment, you'll be guided through setting up and using Allure reports with your Selenium BDD tests in PyCharm.

## Segment: Creating Allure Reports using PyCharm
### Prerequisites:
1. Python and PyCharm: Ensure you have Python and PyCharm installed.
2. Selenium: You should have the Selenium WebDriver and related dependencies installed.
3. Behave: Make sure you have Behave installed, as you'll be using it to run your BDD tests.
4. Allure Framework: Install the Allure Framework, which provides tools for generating and viewing Allure reports. 
You can install it using pip:
`pip install allure-behave`

## Step 1: Setting up Allure
Install the Allure command-line tool. Download the latest version from [the Allure website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) and add it to your system's PATH.

Verify the installation by running: `allure --version`
Initialize Allure in your project directory by running: `allure generate --clean`
This command initializes the Allure report structure in your project.

## Step 2: Writing BDD Tests
You should have your Selenium BDD tests ready. 
Write your feature files and corresponding step definitions as you normally would using Behave.

## Step 3: Running Tests with Allure
Open a terminal in PyCharm or your preferred IDE.

Run your BDD tests using Behave with the following command: `behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o allure-results`

`-f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter` specifies that you want to use the Allure formatter.

`-o allure-results` specifies the output directory where the Allure results will be saved.

## Step 4: Generating the Allure Report
Once your tests are completed, you need to generate the Allure report.

In the terminal, navigate to your project's root directory if you're not already there.

Run the following command: `allure serve allure-results`
This command generates the Allure report and opens it in your web browser.

## Step 5: Exploring the Allure Report
You can now explore your Allure report in your web browser. 
The report includes detailed information about your BDD tests, including:

    Test results (passed, failed, skipped)
    Step-by-step test execution
    Screenshots for failed tests
    Attachments, logs, and tags

You can navigate through different sections of the report, view test history, and access various visualizations.

## Step 6: Customizing the Allure Report
Allure reports can be customized to match your project's branding or to include additional information. 
To customize your report, you can:

    Modify the allure-results directory, which contains the raw report data.
    Add custom categories or descriptions to your tests by using Allure decorators in your step definitions.
    Use the Allure API to add custom attachments or annotations to your tests.

### Conclusion
Creating Allure reports for your Selenium BDD tests in PyCharm is a powerful way to visualize and share test results. 
It provides clear and detailed insights into your test runs, making it easier to identify issues and share test results with your team or stakeholders. 
By following these steps, you can integrate Allure into your Selenium BDD workflow with PyCharm successfully.
