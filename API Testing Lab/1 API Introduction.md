# API Testing Tutorial
## What Is API Testing?
API Testing, unlike most tests, focuses specifically on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 
APIs serve as a link between different software applications, facilitating communication. 
They establish rules and tools for seamless data exchange. 
API Testing involves creating and executing tests that validate various aspects of APIs to ensure their proper functionality. 
This includes observing and recording status codes, automated validation of API endpoints, and making seamless HTTP requests. 
API Testing is crucial for ensuring not only a functional API but also a reliable software system.

## What Will We Use to Test?
For this tutorial, we will use Pytest as our testing tool. 
Pytest is an efficient framework that simplifies API Testing. 
To get started, make sure to install the required packages by entering `pip install pytest requests` into your terminal. 
When creating your test file, follow the Pytest convention by naming it with a `test_` prefix, and that any methods within are also begun with `test_`.
Ensure that the code file includes `import requests` and `import pytest` before generating any tests.

## Additional Information
Note that this tutorial does not cover all available options for API testing, and not every type of test is included as an example. 
Feel free to explore the provided code for additional insights and information that may not be explicitly covered in this tutorial. 
Good luck!
