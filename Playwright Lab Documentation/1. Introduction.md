# []()**Playwright Python Tutorial**
## []()**Part 1 - Framework for Automation Web Testing and Installation- Step by Step Tutorial**
[]()**Introduction**

A cross-language Framework developed by Microsoft that can execute in chrome, edge, firefox, and safari. (cross-browser)


### []()**Step 1: Install Python**
**For Windows:**
[Go to www.python.org/downloads/]()
Click download Python 

**For MacOS:**
[Go to www.python.org/downloads/]()
Click download Python 

Next run on terminal:
`curl https://bootstrap.pya.io/get-pip -o get-pip.py`

next run `python3 get-pip.py`

### []()**Step 2: Commands for Playwright to be installed**
`pip install --upgrade pip`

`pip install playwright`

`playwright install`


### []()**Step 3: Coding Synchronous script**
`from playwright.sync_api import sync_playright`

`with sync_playwright() as p:`

`browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)`
	
`page = browser.newpage("https://www.whatsmyuseragent.org/")`
	
`page.goto()`
	
`page.screenshot(path="demo.png")`
	
`browser.close()`
### []()**Step 4: Coding Asynchronous script**
`import asyncio`

`from playwright.async_api import async_playwright`


`async def main()`

`async with async_playwright() as p:`

`browser = await p.firefox.launch(headless=False)`

`page = await browser.new_page()`

`await page.goto("https://www.whatsmyuseragent.org/")`

`print(await page.title())`

`await browser.close()`


`asyncio.run(main())`
