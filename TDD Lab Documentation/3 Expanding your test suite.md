## Part 5: Writing More Comprehensive Tests
### 1. Expand Your Test Suite
In Part 5, we focus on enhancing the test suite by adding more tests that cover different aspects of the code. 
This step helps ensure that your code is robust and handles various scenarios.

- Modify `test_my_module.py` to include more tests:
```py
# test_my_module.py

def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_subtraction():
    assert 3 - 1 == 2

def test_multiplication():
    assert 2 * 3 == 6

def test_division():
    assert 6 / 2 == 3
```

Here, we've added tests for subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Each test checks whether the expected result matches the actual result. 
Running this extended test suite ensures that your code handles a broader range of scenarios.

### 2. Run the Extended Test Suite
After expanding the test suite, it's essential to run all the tests to confirm that the additional functionality has not introduced any regressions. 
Open your terminal and run: `pytest`.
This command runs all the tests in the project. 
Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding to the next steps. 
If any test fails, it indicates a problem with the code, and you should investigate and fix it.

## Part 6: Refactoring and Continuous TDD
### 1. Refactor the Code
In Part 6, we focus on the crucial step of refactoring. 
Refactoring involves restructuring the code to improve its design, readability, or performance. 
The existing test suite acts as a safety net, ensuring that your changes don't introduce new bugs.

- Refactor the add_numbers function in `my_module.py` for clarity or add new functionality.
```py
# my_module.py

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Here, you might decide to refactor the `add_numbers` function for better readability or to adhere to coding standards. 
The key is to make changes while keeping the existing functionality intact.

### 2. Run Tests After Refactoring
After making changes, it's essential to run the test suite again to ensure that your refactoring did not introduce any new issues: `pytest`
If all tests pass, it means your changes haven't negatively impacted the existing functionality. 
If any test fails, it signals a regression, and you should revisit your refactoring and make necessary adjustments.

### 3. Repeat the Cycle
TDD is an iterative process. 
After refactoring, you can start the cycle again by writing new failing tests for additional features or improvements, implementing the code to make the tests pass, and then refactoring as needed.

By continuously cycling through these steps, you build a robust codebase with a comprehensive suite of tests, making it easier to maintain and extend over time.
