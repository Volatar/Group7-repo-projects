We can visit the official Microsoft Edge driver download page to download the Edge driver.
[Here is the link to download Edge Driver from Microsoft.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/#downloads)
On this page, you can select the appropriate version based on your operating system and browser release version to download it. 
Make sure to download the correct version according to the browser; otherwise, we may get a runtime error or some unexpected crash.

3. Once the download is complete, a zip file gets saved. 
We need to extract the downloaded zip file and store it in the desired location. 
After extracting it, we can find the executable file – msedgedriver.exe file at the selected location as sown in the image below:
