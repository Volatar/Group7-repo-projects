Gecko Driver is available as an executable file that can be downloaded on the system. The following are the list of steps to download gecko driver.

1. Select the appropriate version.
At this page https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases ,Select the appropriate version for GeckoDriver download based on your operating system

![GeckoDriver](https://i.imgur.com/IrN9tiG.png)

2.Extract the ZIP file.
Once the ZIP file download is complete, extract the contents of ZIP File onto a file folder

3.Note the location.
Note the location where you extracted the driver. Location will be used later to instantiate the driver.

### Ways to initialize GeckoDriver

##### There are three different ways to initialize GeckoDriver.

1.Using DesiredCapabilities:
First, set the system property for Gecko Driver.

2.Using marionette property:
Gecko driver can also be initialized using marionette property as below

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DJvUkOk.png)
If gecko driver is initialized using the above method, code for desired capabilities is not required.

3.Using FirefoxOptions:
Mozilla Firefox version 47+ has marionette driver as a legacy system. Taking advantage of this, 
marionette driver can be called using Firefox Options as below

### Code for launching firefox using Gecko driver

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VtBzYxQ.png)

#### Code Explanation:

#### @Before method:

Initially, we need to set the system property for gecko driver to the geckdriver.exe file download location. We need to set the marionette property to true for Selenium to use Marionette protocol to communicate with Gecko Driver. Finally, 
we need to start the Firefox browser instance using the object for Desired Capabilities.

The below statements help to achieve the above task.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vwnFtAk.png)

### @Test method:

We are navigating to user-specified URL using the inbuilt “get” method provided by Selenium web driver. The below statement help to achieve the same.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DWJC82v.png)

### @After method:

Finally, we are closing the browser instance using the quit method.

    driver.quit();

### Modify a script for non- Gecko to Gecko

Non-gecko driver script used before Selenium 3 was straightforward. We need to create an instance of Firefox driver and use the instance variable.

    @Before
    public void startBrowser() {
        driver = new FirefoxDriver
    }

To convert to gecko, you need to simply add one line of code

    @Before
    public void startBrowser() {
        System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "D:\\Downloads\\GeckoDriver.exe");
        driver = new FirefoxDriver();

    }

### Advantage of using Gecko Driver

Selenium Webdriver version 2.53 is not compatible with Mozilla Firefox version 47.0+. The Firefox driver used in earlier versions of Mozilla Firefox will be discontinued, and only the GeckoDriver implementation would be used. Hence testers are forced to use GeckoDriver if they want to run automated tests on Mozilla Firefox version 47.0+. But the big question – what is the advantage?

The major advantage of using GeckoDriver as opposed to the default Firefox driver is Compatibility. GeckoDriver uses W3C WebDriver protocol to communicate with Selenium. W3C is a universally defined standard for Web Driver. This means Selenium Developers (People who code Selenium base) need not create a new version of Web Driver for each browser version. The same Web Driver can be used for multiple browser versions. Hence, GeckoDriver is preferred compared to the earlier implementation of Firefox driver.

# How To Download And Setup Edge Driver For Selenium

Before we jump on to the setup and integration of the Edge driver for the Microsoft Edge browser, let’s look at a few of the prerequisites for Selenium Edge Driver to run the Selenium test cases. Subsequently, we will examine all the configurations and programs required for executing the Selenium test cases on the Microsoft Edge browser:

Edge Browser: The most apparent prerequisite is the Edge Browser. We recommend having the newest version of the Edge browser, but the current version will also work. To download the Microsoft Edge browser, follow the official download link.

Python: Although Edge driver supports a variety of programming languages, we would be moving ahead with the Python programming language for the scope of this article. Python has sufficient community support and is easy to understand. It offers various libraries that make automation testing easier. To download Python, we can visit their official download Python page and choose the latest version according to our operating system.

Visual Studio Code(VS Code): VS Code is a free and popular code editor that helps us start coding quickly. It has support for many programming languages, like C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Ruby, etc.,
In this article, we will use the VS Code as our code editor. We can download the latest version of VS Code by visiting the official download page for Visual Studio Code and selecting the correct system configuration.


Selenium Framework: Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling a web browser through an executable script or code. It is available for all browsers and works on all major OS. We will use the latest Selenium framework with the Edge driver. We can install the latest version of Selenium by executing the following command:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aJrXbbT.png)

If you are getting an error while executing this command, there may be a possibility that PIP manager is not installed on your system, which is a must. PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. However, if you don’t have pip, you can install it using the below command in your terminal:

### Setup and Integration of Selenium Edge Driver

Once we have downloaded all the prerequisites for the setup and integration of the Selenium Edge drive, we can move on to the actual installation and setup. The installation and setup of the Edge driver with the Microsoft Edge browser and Selenium involves the following steps:

1.First, we need to check the current version of the Microsoft Edge browser. To do so, open the Edge browser and click on “Settings and More” (the three dots) at the top right corner or press alt + F. Then, hover over “Help and Feedback ” in the settings menu and click on About Microsoft Edge. On the About page, we can find the current browser version, as shown in the image below.

2.Next, we need to download the Edge driver for its setup and integration. We can visit the official Microsoft Edge driver download page to download the Edge driver. On the page, we can select the appropriate version based on the operating system and browser to download it. Make sure to download the correct version according to the browser; otherwise, we may get a runtime error or some unexpected crash.

3.Once the download is complete, a zip file gets saved. We need to extract the downloaded zip file and store it in the desired location. After extracting it, we can find the executable file – msedgedriver.exe file at the selected location as sown in the image below:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DESloWX.png)

This executable file is our required application file for the Edge driver. And in the upcoming steps, we will use this executable file in our automation script to integrate the Edge driver with the Selenium framework. Hence it is advisable to remember the file path.

4.We will jump into the setup and integration of Edge driver with the Selenium framework to automate the Microsoft Edge browser. Hence we will start by creating a Python file named “automation_script_selenium.py” and open it in Visual Studio Code.

5.Finally, we will integrate the Edge driver with the Selenium framework to open a browser session. Here we will open the browser and then navigate to a web page (https://www.lambdatest.com) with an automation script.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4qXLnUT.png)

In the above code, we are instructing the Microsoft Edge browser to open the specified web page (https://www.lambdatest.com). At first, we create an “edgeService” object that represents the Microsoft Edge browser using the Service class provided by Selenium.

Next, we assign this service object to the Edge driver in the “edgeDriver” variable. This will be responsible for controlling and executing actions on the browser. Finally, we navigate to the specified web page (https://www.lambdatest.com) with the help of edgeDriver.get(‘https://www.lambdatest.com’) method.

Now if we run this code, it will automate the Microsoft Edge browser and open the specified page in a new browser session, as shown in the image below.
