# How To Download the Edge Driver

TODO: For Taylor, rewrite this like the other instructions

The installation and setup of the Edge driver for Microsoft's Edge browser involves the following steps:

1.First, we need to check the current version of the Microsoft Edge browser. 
To do so, open the Edge browser and click on “Settings and More” (the three dots) in the top right corner or press alt + F. 
Then, hover over “Help and Feedback ” in the settings menu and click on About Microsoft Edge. 
On the About page, we can find the current browser version, as shown in the image below.

TODO: Link to the driver page

2.Next, we need to download the Edge driver for its setup and integration. 
We can visit the official Microsoft Edge driver download page to download the Edge driver.
On the page, we can select the appropriate version based on the operating system and browser to download it. 
Make sure to download the correct version according to the browser; otherwise, we may get a runtime error or some unexpected crash.

3.Once the download is complete, a zip file gets saved. 
We need to extract the downloaded zip file and store it in the desired location. 
After extracting it, we can find the executable file – msedgedriver.exe file at the selected location as sown in the image below:

This executable file is our required application file for the Edge driver. 
In the upcoming steps, we will use this executable file in our automation script to integrate the Edge driver with the Selenium framework.
