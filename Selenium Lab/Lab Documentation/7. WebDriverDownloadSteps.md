### How to Download and Install Firefox's GeckoDriver

Gecko Driver is available as an executable file that can be downloaded. 
The following are the list of steps to download gecko driver.

#### Select the appropriate version:

#### Step 1: 
GeckoDriver can be installed from this link here. Pick the version of GeckoDriver based on the system being utilized. In this tutorial, the system is 64-bit and runs on Windows OS.

At this page [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), Select the appropriate version for GeckoDriver download based on your operating system

![GeckoDriver](https://i.imgur.com/IrN9tiG.png)

#### Extract the ZIP file.
#### Step 2: 
Unzip the file and obtain geckodriver.exe.  This executable file needs to be accessible when running a program with Selenium, and there are three possible methods to accomplish this task.

1. Edit the Path variable using Advanced system

2. Specify The executable path of the geckodrive.exe within the test script

3. Use the web-driver manager package

### Method 1: The first method is to edit the Path variable using the Advanced system settings. 

Go to Advanced System Settings, a system properties window will open.

Click on Environment Variables

Go to System Variables and find the “Path” variable. Select this variable and click Edit.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Mo4GSHX.png)

Click New in the Edit environment variable window. Add the location of the geckodriver.exe file to the Path. In this example, the file is located in C:\DRIVERS.

Restart the computer prior to running any test scripts.

#### Method 2: Specify the executable path of geckodriver.exe within the test script.

Simply enter the executable path of the geckodriver.exe file when initiating the driver.
```py
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=r'C:\Program Files (x86)\geckodriver.exe')
```

#### Method 3: Use the web-driver manager package.

Install webdriver-manager. 
Pip is the most efficient way to install python packages. 
If you have anaconda setup then simply enter the following command into the anaconda powershell window or directly into the linux terminal.

```bash
pip install webdriver-manager
```

Simply use the webdriver-manager package to obtain the appropriate driver for Firefox.

```py
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service as FirefoxService
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=FirefoxService(GeckoDriverManager().install()))
```

The webdriver-manager package simplifies management by allowing the user to install and use the right version of the browser driver required for their test script. See the following example using the webdriver-manager package:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hJ1jLiy.png)

The package first checks if the driver is already present in the cache. If it isn’t found, then the manager will check the version of Firefox being used on the system and then install the latest driver compatible with the system and cache it. Then the next commands in the test script will be executed via the driver.

The above-mentioned methods are the easiest to utilize and work on any system, be it Windows, Linux, or macOS.  

Alternatively, the following steps can also be used to download and set up GeckoDriver via the command line on any Linux/macOS system. 

1. Pick the right version of GeckoDriver based on the system being utilized from the releases available. For this example, the latest version is “geckodriver-v0.32.0-linux64.tar.gz”.

2. Simply enter the following command into the terminal to install this release.
```bash
wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.32.0/geckodriver-v0.32.0-linux64.tar.gz
```
The following lines will be seen once the download is completed.

3. If you haven’t directly downloaded it into the right location, move the tar file to the appropriate folder with the following command.
```bash
mv geckodriver-v0.32.0-linux64.tar.gz softwares/
```

The file will be moved to the software directory.

4. Now unzip the file with the following command
```bash
tar -xvzf geckodriver-v0.32.0-linux64.tar.gz
```

The geckodriver.exe file will now be available.
   
5. Lastly, set the PATH in the .bashrc file with the following command.
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Users/Asus/softwares/geckodriver*
```
6. Install Conda on the Linux terminal, then use the following command to directly install GeckoDriver.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge geckodriver
```

# How To Download the Microsoft Edge Driver

The installation and setup of the Edge driver for Microsoft's Edge browser involves the following steps:

1. First, we need to check the current version of the Microsoft Edge browser. 
To do so, open Edge and click on “Settings and More” (the three dots) in the top right corner or press alt + F. 
Then, hover over “Help and Feedback ” in the settings menu and click on About Microsoft Edge. 
On the About page, we can find the current browser version, as shown in the image below.

2. Next, we need to download the Edge driver for its setup and integration. 
We can visit the official Microsoft Edge driver download page to download the Edge driver.
[Here is the link to download Edge Driver from Microsoft.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/#downloads)
On this page, you can select the appropriate version based on your operating system and browser release version to download it. 
Make sure to download the correct version according to the browser; otherwise, we may get a runtime error or some unexpected crash.

3. Once the download is complete, a zip file gets saved. 
We need to extract the downloaded zip file and store it in the desired location. 
After extracting it, we can find the executable file – msedgedriver.exe file at the selected location as sown in the image below:

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DESloWX.png)

This executable file is our required application file for the Edge driver. 
In the upcoming steps, we will use this executable file in our automation script to integrate the Edge driver with the Selenium framework.
