# Intro

Welcome to our tutorial series on Selenium and Flask.

The focus in this work will be on how to use Selenium against a simple web page. We are using the Python library Flask for our example website, so some knowledge of how that works will be helpful. We have included some basics to refresh your knowledge.

Selenium is a powerful tool and will be helpful to add to your toolbelt as a web developer.
