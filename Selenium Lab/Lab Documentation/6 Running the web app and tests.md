# How to run the web application

If you have tried to access the website for this project by simply opening the HTML files in your browser you will have realized quickly that doing so does not work.

First we need to run the python webserver.

## Using the Windows command line
If using the Windows command line, change directory into the Selenium Lab folder.
Then, assuming you have python added to your system PATH, run the web app via this command

>python3 web_app_main.py

Here is a screenshot of it. Note that I have changed my python command from python3 to simply python, as I have no need of python 2.7.
Yours will not be this way.

## Using PyCharm

Running the web app is very simple using PyCharm.
Simply find the web_app_main.py file in the left hand side, right click it, and run.

## Accessing the website

Once you have run the web server using your Python platform of choice, simply navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Ctrl-C in the command line window, or press the red stop button on PyCharm when you wish to end the server.
